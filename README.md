# Task-1

The website includes all the basic details, such as the event schedule, location, date, time, registration form, etc.
The website is easy to navigate and user-friendly. The visitors can easily find all the necessary information they need about the event. 
It is pretty much responsive, and it looks good on all devices, including desktops, laptops, tablets, and mobile phones.
In terms of the technology, I used HTML, CSS, Tailwind CSS, and JavaScript with well-structured code.
